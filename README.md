<h1> Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
<block>
<p>Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This simple yet classic game is implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
</p>
 <h2> How to Play</h2>
   <ol>
<li>Run the Python script tic_tac_toe.py to launch the game.</li>
<li>The game window will appear, and you will see a 3x3 grid of buttons.</li>
<li>Players take turns clicking on the empty spaces to place their symbol (X or O).</li>
<li>The first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins.</li>
<li>If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.</li>
     </ol>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the scores for both Player X and Player O. The scores are displayed on the GUI.</li>
<li>Options Menu: The menu bar at the top provides options to reset the game or start a new one.</li>
<li>Visual Indication: Winning combinations and ties are visually highlighted on the board.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Code Structure</h3>
The code is organized into functions to handle various aspects of the game, such as button clicks, checking for a win, resetting the game, and starting a new game. The use of Tkinter allows for a simple and interactive user interface.
